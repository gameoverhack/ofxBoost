========

Compiled Boost libs and headers for OSX and Windows (based on version 1.46 and compiled with GCC 4.6+). To use just link against the libs you require - there is no need to add all the header files to your project usually (just point your compiler at the correct header search paths). I find it easiest to drag and drop the libs to my Xcode project on Mac, on Windows I add them to the lib include paths.
